Support for "unifying" the thread-safety mechanisms between ncdata and other packages.

Each of the data-format packages (ncdata, iris and xarray) uses its own locking
mechanism to prevent overlapping calls into the netcdf library when called by
multi-threaded code.

Most commonly, this occurs when netcdf file data is read to
compute a Dask array, or written in a Dask delayed write operation.

All 3 data-format packages (ncdata, Iris and xarray) can map variable data into Dask
lazy arrays on file load.  Iris and Xarray can also create delayed write operations
(but ncdata currently does not).

However, those mechanisms cannot protect an operation of that package from
overlapping with one in *another* package.

This module can ensure that all of the enabled packages use the *same* thread lock,
so that any and all of them can safely co-operate in parallel operations.

sample usages::

    from ncdata.threadlock_sharing import enable_lockshare, disable_lockshare
    from ncdata.xarray import from_xarray
    from ncdata.iris import from_iris, to_iris
    from ncdata.netcdf4 import to_nc4, from_nc4

    enable_lockshare(iris=True, xarray=True)

    ds = from_xarray(xarray.open_dataset(file1))
    ds2 = from_iris(iris.load(file2))
    ds.variables['x'].data /= ds2.variables['acell'].data
    to_nc4(ds, output_filepath)

    disable_lockshare()

or::

    with lockshare_context(iris=True):
        ncdata = from_nc4(source_filepath)
        my_adjust_process(ncdata)
        data_cube = to_iris(ncdata).extract("main_var")
        grid_cube = iris.load_cube(grid_path, "grid_cube")
        result_cube = data_cube.regrid(grid_cube)
        iris.save(result_cube, output_filepath)

.. WARNING::
    The solution in this module is at present still experimental, and not itself
    thread-safe.  So probably can only be applied at the outer level of an operation.

    -----
    If an ``enable_lockshare`` call was already established, the function does nothing,
    i.e. it is not possible to modify an existing share.  Instead, you must call
    :func:`disable_lockshare` to cancel the current sharing, before you can establish
    a new one.

    While sharing with *both* iris and xarray, iris is modified to use the same netcdf
    lock as xarray.
